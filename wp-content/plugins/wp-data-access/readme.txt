== Description ==
WP Data Access is a powerful data administration, publication, and development tool. This highly customizable plugin allows users to perform database-related tasks from the WordPress dashboard through an intuitive user interface, enabling the creation of fully responsive publications, charts, and data administration pages. No programming skills required!

The plugin supports more complex features for advanced users, including remote database and file access, master-detail pages, lookups, inline editing, advanced search options, and WordPress role management integration. Additionally, it acts as an additional layer around your WordPress database, allowing you to add database tables and view specific functionality such as dynamic hyperlinks and WordPress media library integration.

Programmers can also benefit from the WP Data Access API, which can be used to access remote databases and data files directly from their PHP code.

### Data Publisher

Key elements of Data Publisher include the ability to easily add export buttons, search panes, the search builder, and to employ professional page styling using the intuitive premium user interface. Advanced and premium features are available for users who want to get the most out of their publications and harness the true power of this tool.

### Remote database and file access
> WP Data Access supports seamless access to several remote databases (SQL Server, Oracle, ProgreSQL, MariaDB/MySQL, and MS Access) and remote data files (CSV, JSON, and XML). To facilitate this access, the remote connection wizard helps premium users set up the connection. However, documentation is available for free users (requires DBMS and OS knowledge and root access).

Database tables created from remote database connections and remote data files are available from all plugin tools. Publications, charts, and projects can utilize these database tables.

#### Remote SQL Server example
Make sure your SQL Server is accessible. Premium users can use the remote connection wizard to create a database table using a remote connection to your SQL Server.
#### Remote CSV files example
Make your CSV file available from a public URL. Use the remote connection wizard to load your CSV file into a database table and add an update interval. Maintain your CSV file with your favorite spreadsheet program while WP Data Access synchronizes your table at your desired update intervals.

### Charts
> Charts are created from SQL queries. Use the Query Builder to manage your queries and copy them into your charts. The Visual Query Builder is a premium feature that can be used by those with little or no SQL knowledge.
